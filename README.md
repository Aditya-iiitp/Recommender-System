# Recommender-System
Recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users. Collaborative methods for recommender systems are methods that are based solely on the past interactions recorded between users and items in order to produce new recommendations.
This project contains the Recommender System made only using User- based Collaborative Filtering.
